# 🚀 Code2Report — AI-Powered Developer Reporting, Done Right

**Code2Report** is an AI-driven reporting tool that transforms raw developer activity into insightful, structured summaries — with zero effort from the team.

Unlike traditional dashboards that overload you with metrics, Code2Report provides *qualitative insights* — helping tech leads and managers understand what’s happening in their codebase, without digging through commits or holding endless status meetings.
